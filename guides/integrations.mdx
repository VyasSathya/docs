# Integrations

buildwhatever integrates with your existing tools to automatically capture feedback, bug reports, and errors as actionable tasks.

## How Integrations Work

All integrations use webhooks. When an event occurs (a new GitHub issue, a Slack message, a Sentry error), the source sends data to your buildwhatever webhook URL. buildwhatever then:

1. **Authenticates** the request using your webhook token
2. **Classifies** the content as bug or feedback
3. **Creates a task** with appropriate priority, tags, and metadata
4. **Deduplicates** to avoid creating duplicate tasks

### Webhook URL Format

```
https://app.buildwhatever.dev/api/webhooks/{integration}?token={webhook_secret}
```

---

## GitHub Issues

Automatically create tasks from GitHub issues. Great for tracking bug reports and feature requests.

### Setup

1. Go to **Settings > Integrations** in buildwhatever
2. Click **Enable** on GitHub integration
3. Copy your webhook URL and secret
4. In your GitHub repo, go to **Settings > Webhooks > Add webhook**
5. Configure:
   - **Payload URL:** your buildwhatever webhook URL
   - **Content type:** `application/json`
   - **Events:** select **Issues** (and optionally **Issue comments**)

### Classification

Issues are classified as **bugs** if labels or content contain: `bug`, `error`, `crash`, `fix`, `broken`, `fail`, `issue`, `exception`. Everything else is classified as **feedback**.

### Priority Mapping

| GitHub Labels | buildwhatever Priority |
|---------------|----------------------|
| `critical`, `urgent`, `p0`, `p1` | High |
| `p2`, `medium-priority` | Medium |
| `low-priority`, `p3`, `minor` | Low |
| No priority labels | Default (High for bugs) |

### Sync Behavior

| GitHub Event | buildwhatever Action |
|--------------|---------------------|
| Issue opened | Create new task |
| Issue closed | Mark task as done |
| Issue reopened | Reopen task |

---

## Email

Turn support emails into tasks automatically. Works with Mailgun, SendGrid, Postmark, or any email provider with inbound parsing.

### Setup

1. Go to **Settings > Integrations** in buildwhatever
2. Click **Enable** on Email integration
3. Select your email provider
4. Copy your webhook URL
5. Configure your email provider to forward to that URL

**Mailgun:**
- Go to Sending > Routes
- Create route matching your support address (e.g., `bugs@yourdomain.com`)
- Forward to your buildwhatever webhook URL

**SendGrid:**
- Go to Settings > Inbound Parse
- Add your domain and buildwhatever webhook URL

**Postmark:**
- Go to your Server > Inbound
- Set the webhook URL to your buildwhatever endpoint

### Configuration Options

- **Allowed senders** — restrict to specific domains (e.g., `*@company.com`)
- **Default priority** — set priority for new tasks
- **Auto-classify** — enable/disable bug vs feedback classification

---

## Slack

Capture feedback from Slack channels and create tasks automatically.

### Setup

1. Create a Slack App at [api.slack.com/apps](https://api.slack.com/apps)
2. Enable **Event Subscriptions** and set the Request URL to your buildwhatever webhook
3. Subscribe to bot events: `message.channels`, `message.groups`, `reaction_added`
4. Install the app to your workspace
5. In buildwhatever, go to **Settings > Integrations**, enable Slack, and enter your Slack Signing Secret

### Configuration

| Setting | Description | Default |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Allowed Channels** | Channel IDs to monitor | All |
| **Trigger Words** | Keywords that create tasks | `feedback`, `bug`, `feature request` |
| **Trigger Reactions** | Emoji that create tasks | `:eyes:`, `:memo:`, `:bug:` |
| **Default Priority** | Priority for new tasks | Medium |

A task is created when a message contains a trigger word or someone adds a trigger reaction to a message.

---

## Sentry

Automatically create tasks from Sentry errors with deduplication and error count tracking.

### Setup

1. In buildwhatever, go to **Settings > Integrations** and enable Sentry
2. Copy your webhook URL
3. In Sentry, go to **Settings > Integrations > Webhooks**
4. Add a new webhook with your buildwhatever URL
5. Enable for: `issue.created`, `issue.resolved`, `issue.unresolved`

### Sync Behavior

| Sentry Event | buildwhatever Action |
|--------------|---------------------|
| `issue.created` | Create task (or increment count if duplicate) |
| `issue.resolved` | Mark task as done |
| `issue.unresolved` | Reopen task |

### Priority Mapping

| Sentry Level | Priority |
|--------------|---------|
| `fatal` | High |
| `error` | High |
| `warning` | Medium |
| `info` | Low |

## MCP Server

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) server lets AI assistants like Claude manage your tasks.

### Setup with Claude Desktop

Add to your Claude Desktop config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "buildwhatever": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@buildwhatever/mcp-server"],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

### Available Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `get_tasks` | List tasks with filters |
| `create_task` | Create a new task |
| `update_task` | Modify a task |
| `complete_task` | Mark task as done |
| `start_task` | Start working on task |
| `get_inbox` | View errors and feedback |
| `search_tasks` | Search by title |

### Example Prompts

- "What's on my task list?"

## Troubleshooting

### Webhook Not Receiving Events

1. Verify the URL format includes your token: `https://app.buildwhatever.dev/api/webhooks/{type}?token=YOUR_TOKEN`
2. Test the endpoint by visiting the URL in your browser
3. Check webhook logs in **Settings > Integrations > View Logs**
4. If using signature verification, make sure secrets match

### Tasks Not Being Created

1. Confirm the integration is enabled in **Settings > Integrations**
2. Check your filters (some integrations filter by level, sender, etc.)
3. Check for duplicates — tasks with the same external ID update existing tasks instead of creating new ones

### Authentication Issues

**CLI:** Run `buildwhatever logout` then `buildwhatever login --browser`

**Browser Extension:** Click the extension icon > Logout > Re-authenticate

**MCP Server:** Delete `~/.buildwhatever` and restart Claude Desktop
