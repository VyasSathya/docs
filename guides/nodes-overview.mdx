# Nodes Overview

Traditional productivity tools give you a blank canvas. buildwhatever gives you **specialized tools for common tasks**.

## The Problem with a Blank Canvas

- "How do I price my services?" — Google it, read 10 articles, make a spreadsheet
- "How do I validate my idea?" — Buy a course, take notes, build your own framework
- "How do I grow on Twitter?" — Trial and error for months

## The Node Solution

- "How do I price my services?" — Open the **Pricing Calculator** node, enter your costs, get recommended pricing
- "How do I validate my idea?" — Open the **User Research** node, use the interview template, log responses
- "How do I grow on Twitter?" — Open the **Growth on X** node, follow a proven playbook

**Nodes = Distilled expertise + Automation**

## Node Categories

### Service Business

**For:** Coaches, consultants, freelancers, service providers

**Focus:** Client management, pricing, service delivery

**Nodes:**
- Client Intake Form Generator
- Session Notes System
- Pricing Calculator
- Service Agreement Templates
- Client Onboarding Workflow

**Why a separate category?** Service businesses have fundamentally different needs than product companies — no code, no deployment. The focus is on people, 1-on-1 delivery, and compliance (contracts, insurance).

### Creative Commerce

**For:** Artists, designers, photographers, creators

**Focus:** Product creation, platform selection, marketing

**Nodes:**
- Product Photography Guide
- Print-on-Demand Platform Comparison
- Etsy vs Shopify Decision Tree
- Pricing Formula (cost + time + market)
- Portfolio Website Builder

**Why a separate category?** Creative businesses need help with physical/digital product workflows, platform selection, and visual merchandising — none of which require coding.

### Product Development

**For:** Developers, founders, product builders

**Focus:** Building and launching software products

**Available nodes (11 total):**
- Growth on X/Twitter
- User Research & Validation
- React Performance Optimization
- Database Design
- Landing Page Design
- SEO Fundamentals
- Product Hunt Launch
- Analytics & Metrics
- AI Video Creation
- AI UI Design
- Expo Mobile Deployment

This is the most built-out category since the buildwhatever team uses these tools internally.

### Universal

**For:** Everyone, regardless of business type

**Focus:** Common business fundamentals

**Nodes:**
- Find Your First 10 Customers
- Competition Research
- Email List Builder
- Social Media Content Planner
- Market Sizing Calculator

These work whether you're a service provider finding coaching clients, an artist finding collectors, or a developer finding beta users.

## How Nodes Integrate with Your Workflow

### Contextual Discovery

Nodes are linked to milestones in your journey map. They appear when you need them.

**Example: "Launch Coaching Business" workspace**

```
Track: Client Acquisition
├── Milestone: "Define Your Niche"
│   └── Market Research Guide, Competition Analysis
├── Milestone: "Price Your Services"
│   └── Pricing Calculator, Value-Based Pricing Guide
└── Milestone: "Find First 5 Clients"
    └── Outreach Templates, Find First 10 Customers
```

### Three Ways to Open Nodes

1. **From milestone cards** — click a milestone, then click its "Learn More" badges
2. **From the AI assistant** — ask for help and it will recommend and open relevant nodes
3. **From the node browser** — browse all nodes by category *(coming soon)*

### Tabs Interface

Nodes open as tabs in your workspace, just like browser tabs:

```
[Journey Map] [User Research] [Pricing Calc] [Chat]
```

Keep multiple nodes open, reference them while working, and switch with keyboard shortcuts.

## What Makes a Good Node

- **Actionable** — you can do something after reading or using it
- **Focused** — solves one specific problem well
- **Proven** — based on real-world success, not theory
- **Current** — updated to reflect the latest best practices
- **Fast** — guides take under 30 minutes to read; interactive nodes take under 5 minutes to use
