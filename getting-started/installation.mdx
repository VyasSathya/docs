## Platform Access

buildwhatever runs entirely in your browser — there's nothing to install.

### Web App

The main experience lives at [app.buildwhatever.dev](https://app.buildwhatever.dev). Works on any modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

### Mobile

A native mobile app for iOS and Android is coming soon. In the meantime, the web app works on mobile browsers.

### Optional: CLI

For power users who prefer the terminal:

```bash
npm install -g @buildwhatever/cli
```

After installing, authenticate:

```bash
buildwhatever login --browser
```

See the [Integrations guide](/guides/integrations) for CLI usage details.

### Optional: VS Code Extension

Manage tasks directly from your editor:

```bash
code --install-extension buildwhatever.buildwhatever-vscode
```

See the [Integrations guide](/guides/integrations) for setup instructions.

## Verify Setup

Once you're signed in, you'll see the workspace creation screen. If you see it, you're all set.
