# Create Your First Workspace

A **workspace** is your project container. Each workspace comes with an AI-generated plan, tracks, milestones, tasks, and recommended tools.

## What's in a Workspace?

- **Profile** — a guided workflow tailored to your goal (e.g., "Launch Coaching Business", "Build SaaS App")
- **Tracks** — parallel workstreams (e.g., Discovery, Marketing, Build)
- **Milestones** — key steps within each track
- **Nodes** — mini-apps and guides to help you succeed
- **Tasks** — your to-do list and progress tracker

## Creating a Workspace

### Step 1: Describe Your Goal

After signing in, you'll see: **"What do you want to do?"**

Be specific — the AI uses this to recommend the right profile and tools.

**Examples:**
- "Start a health coaching business"
- "Sell my art online"
- "Build a SaaS app for project management"
- "Launch a newsletter about comedy writing"

### Step 2: Review Your Generated Profile

The AI analyzes your goal and creates a custom workflow. You'll see:

- **Profile name** — e.g., "Launch Coaching Business"
- **Tracks** — parallel workstreams with milestones
- **Reasoning** — why this profile was chosen

Edit the workspace name if you want something different.

### Step 3: Choose Workspace Type

**Local workspace:**
- Connect to a folder on your computer
- The AI assistant can access files in that folder
- Adds terminal and file explorer tabs
- Best for: coding projects, file-heavy work

**Cloud workspace:**
- No folder connection needed
- Hides terminal and file explorer tabs
- Best for: planning, research, service businesses

### Step 4: Create

Click **"Create Workspace"** and you're in.

## Your Workspace Layout

After creation, you'll see:

### Journey Map

A visual board showing your tracks and milestones:

```
Discovery Track ────────────────────>
  ○ Not Started   ● In Progress   ✓ Done

Marketing Track ────────────────────>
  🔒 Locked   ○ Not Started   ● In Progress
```

Locked milestones unlock when prerequisites are complete.

### Available Tabs

**Every workspace has:**
- Tasks — kanban board, calendar, and list views
- Chat — AI assistant with full project context
- Journey Map — visual progress tracker

**Local workspaces also have:**
- Terminal — run commands directly
- File Explorer — browse project files

### Recommended Nodes

Based on your profile, you'll see relevant nodes attached to milestones. Click a milestone to see its recommended tools and guides.

## Managing Multiple Workspaces

Have multiple projects? Create multiple workspaces.

**Switch between them via:**

Each workspace maintains separate tasks, progress, and AI context.

## Tips for Success

- **Start with one workspace** — don't overwhelm yourself

- **Use the nodes** — they contain proven frameworks
- **Talk to the AI assistant** — it knows your project context
- **Mark milestones done** — track your progress
