# Understanding Nodes

Nodes are focused tools that solve one specific problem. Think of them as a library of specialized mini-apps and guides.

## What is a Node?

A **node** is a focused app or guide built around a single task.

**Examples:**
- **Pricing Calculator** — helps you price services or products
- **User Research Guide** — step-by-step framework for customer interviews
- **Growth on X** — a playbook for building an audience on Twitter/X
- **Database Schema Designer** — visual tool to plan your database
- **Competition Research** — automated competitor analysis

## Two Types of Nodes

### Guide Nodes (Read & Learn)

Educational content with frameworks and best practices.

**What's inside:**
- Rich content — articles, checklists, comparisons
- External resources — tools, templates, articles
- Code examples (for developer nodes)
- Step-by-step workflows

**Example: "User Research Guide"**
- Section 1: Why research matters
- Section 2: Jobs-to-be-Done framework
- Section 3: Interview script template
- Section 4: Analyzing responses
- Resources: Notion templates, recording tools

**Best for:** Learning foundational concepts and proven frameworks.

### Interactive Nodes (Do Something)

Mini-apps that process your input and generate useful output.

**How they work:**
- You fill out a form with your data or requirements
- The node processes it (using AI or automation)
- You get generated files, configs, reports, or templates

**Example: "Pricing Calculator"**
- Input: your costs, time investment, market research
- Processing: applies pricing formulas
- Output: recommended pricing tiers with rationale

**Best for:** Getting things done fast.

## How to Find Nodes

### From the Journey Map

1. Open your workspace and go to the Journey Map tab
2. Click any milestone card
3. Look for **"Learn More"** badges
4. Click a badge to open the node

Nodes are contextual — you only see the ones relevant to your current milestone.

### From the AI Assistant

Ask the AI assistant:
- "Show me nodes about pricing"
- "What nodes help with customer research?"
- "I need help with Instagram marketing"

The assistant will recommend relevant nodes and open them for you.

## Using a Node

### Opening Nodes

Nodes open as **tabs** in the workspace interface, just like browser tabs.

You can:
- Open multiple nodes at once
- Switch between them with keyboard shortcuts
- Pin important nodes for quick access
- Close them when you're done

### Reading Guide Nodes

- **Left sidebar:** table of contents
- **Center:** main content
- **Right sidebar:** progress tracker, code examples, external resources, related nodes

**Actions you can take:**
- Bookmark sections for later
- Mark sections as complete
- Ask the AI assistant about any content

### Using Interactive Nodes

Typical flow:
1. Fill out the input form
2. Click "Generate" or "Process"
3. Review the output
4. Download, copy, or save the result
5. Implement in your project

## Node vs Task vs Milestone

| Concept | What It Is | Example |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| **Milestone** | A big goal to achieve | "Find 5 potential customers" |
| **Node** | A tool to help achieve a milestone | "Customer Research Guide" |
| **Task** | An individual to-do item | "Interview Sarah from the Facebook group" |

**How they connect:**
1. Journey Map shows a **milestone**
2. Click the milestone to see recommended **nodes**
3. Use nodes to learn and get things done
4. Create **tasks** for specific actions
5. Mark the milestone done when complete

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Do I have to use nodes?">
    No. Nodes are optional tools. You can work directly with tasks and the AI assistant.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I request new nodes?">
    Yes! Submit ideas via Discord or the feedback form.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Why are some nodes marked 'coming soon'?">
    We're prioritizing nodes based on user demand. Service business and creative commerce nodes are in development.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Do nodes work offline?">
    Guide nodes are cached locally. Interactive nodes require an internet connection since they use AI processing.
