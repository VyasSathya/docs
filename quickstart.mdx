# Quickstart

Get your first project up and running in five steps.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Sign up">
    Create your free account at [buildwhatever.dev](https://buildwhatever.dev). No credit card required.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Describe your project">
    Tell the AI what you want to build. Be specific — the more detail you give, the better your plan will be.

    **Examples:**
    - "I want to start a health coaching business"
    - "I want to sell my art prints online"
    - "Build a project management SaaS with team collaboration"
    - "Launch a newsletter about comedy writing"
  </Step>

  <Step title="Get your AI-generated plan">
    The AI analyzes your goal and creates a custom workspace with:
    - **Tracks** — parallel workstreams (e.g., Marketing, Build, Legal)
    - **Milestones** — key steps within each track
    - **Recommended nodes** — specialized tools and guides for each milestone

    Review the plan, rename your workspace if you'd like, and create it.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start building">
    Open your workspace and start working through milestones. Use the AI assistant to:
    - Get advice on next steps
    - Generate content, code, or plans
    - Open relevant nodes for guided workflows
    - Create and manage tasks
  </Step>

  <Step title="Ship">
    Track your progress across all tracks. Mark milestones complete as you go. The AI adapts its recommendations based on your progress.
  </Step>
</Steps>
